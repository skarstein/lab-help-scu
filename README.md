# Labratory Help-seeking System for SCU COEN 174L
Nicholas Goodpaster, Sean Karstein, Bryson Lee - Fall 2017

We have built a web application that improves the efficiency of the question asking and
answering process in engineering lab sessions at Santa Clara University. Currently, students
raise their hands and wait for the teaching assistant to answer them in person. This hampers
both speed and fairness for students. Existing solutions like email lack the speed and
personalization of our system. Our solution allows teaching assistants to quickly asses the
most common questions, making sure that students are answered in a quick and fair manner.
Our application streamlines the question asking process and allows for a more enjoyable lab
experience for both students and teaching assistants.
